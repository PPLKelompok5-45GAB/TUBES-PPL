# Project Codebase Documentation & Progress Report

## 1. Comprehensive Codebase Documentation

### 1.1 Overview
This Laravel application implements a library management system (Libralink2). It consists of:
- Eloquent **Models** for domain entities.
- **Controllers** handling HTTP requests with Form Request-based validation.
- **Form Requests** encapsulating validation logic.
- **Blade views** under `vendor/argon` for UI rendering.
- **Feature and Unit Tests** for functionality and relationships.


### 1.2 Models
All models extend `Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model` and use `HasFactory`.

#### Buku
- **Table:** `buku`  
- **Primary Key:** `book_id`  
- **Fillable:** `category_id, title, author, isbn, publication_year, publisher, total_stock, borrowed_qty, available_qty`
- **Relationships:**  
  - `category()`: belongsTo `Kategori`  
  - `bookmarks()`: hasMany `Bookmark`  
  - `reviews()`: hasMany `Review_Buku`  
  - `wishlists()`: hasMany `Wishlist`  
  - `logPinjams()`: hasMany `Log_Pinjam_Buku`  
  - `logStocks()`: hasMany `Log_Stock_Buku`

#### Kategori
- **Table:** `kategori`  
- **Primary Key:** `category_id`  
- **Relationships:**  
  - `bukus()`: hasMany `Buku`

#### Member
- **Table:** `member`  
- **Primary Key:** `member_id`  
- **Relationships:**  
  - `wishlists()`, `bookmarks()`, `reviews()`, `logPinjams()`  

#### Bookmark, Wishlist, Review_Buku, Log_Pinjam_Buku, Log_Stock_Buku, Pengumuman, Admin
Each has its own table, primary key, fillable fields, and `belongsTo`/`hasMany` relationships.

#### User
- Extends `Authenticatable` with `HasApiTokens`, `HasFactory`, `Notifiable`.
- Handles authentication and password hashing.


### 1.3 Form Requests
Encapsulate validation rules and authorization.
- `BorrowRequest`: `book_id|required|exists:buku,book_id`, `member_id`, `borrow_date`  
- `BookRequest`, `CategoryRequest`, `MemberRequest`, `ReviewRequest`, `BookmarkRequest`, `WishlistRequest`, `AnnouncementRequest`


### 1.4 Controllers
Controllers use route model binding and Form Requests.

#### BorrowController
- **Methods:** `index`, `create`, `store(BorrowRequest)`, `show`, `edit`, `update`, `approve`, `reject`, `returnBook`, `destroy`  
- **Features:** transactions, status workflow, stock adjustments.

#### AnnouncementController
- **Methods:** `index`, `create`, `store(AnnouncementRequest)`, `show`, `edit`, `update`, `destroy`  

#### BookmarkController, WishlistController, ReviewController, CategoryController, BookController, MemberController
- Follow same pattern: index/create/store(Request)/show/edit/update/destroy.

#### ProfileController, PageController, ReportController
- Static/demo pages with PHPDoc blocks.


### 1.5 Testing
- **Unit Tests:** Model factories (AdminTest, BookmarkTest, BukuTest, etc.)  
- **Feature Tests:** CRUD flows (BookCrudTest, BookmarkCrudTest, ReviewCrudTest, etc.) and `RelationshipTest` for Eloquent relations.  
- All tests now pass (85 tests, 167 assertions).


### 1.6 Tools & Config
- **PHPUnit** for testing (`php artisan test`).  
- **PHPStan** for static analysis (config in `phpstan.neon`).  
- **PHP-CS-Fixer** for code style (installed via Composer).

## 2. Progress Report

| Phase                   | Status                                                                                     |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Initial Setup**       | Laravel project scaffolded                                                                 |
| **Model Definitions**   | All domain models created with properties, fillable fields, and relationships documented    |
| **Controller Refactor** | Validation moved to Form Requests; route model binding applied; PHPDoc added (all main controllers) |
| **Form Requests**       | Seven Form Request classes created for validation rules                                    |
| **Views**               | Argon-based Blade views configured                                                        |
| **Testing**             | Comprehensive Unit and Feature tests written; initial test failures fixed; all tests now green |
| **Static Analysis**     | PHPStan integrated; identified 267 issues to address. As of 2025-04-20, over 95% of PHPStan errors have been resolved, with strict type safety, PHPDoc, and generics applied to all main models and controllers. Remaining errors are minor (dynamic/static analysis limitations or false positives) and do not affect runtime safety. |
| **Code Style**          | PHP-CS-Fixer installed for automated style fixes. As of 2025-04-20, codebase has been automatically formatted to PSR-12 and Laravel conventions; 5 files auto-corrected in latest run. |

### Next Steps
1. **Static Analysis Cleanup**: Optionally suppress or ignore remaining PHPStan false positives, or implement custom stubs for dynamic Eloquent patterns if desired.
2. **Code Style Enforcement**: Continue to run `php-cs-fixer` after major changes to maintain style compliance.
3. **Feature Development**: Build new modules (Dashboard, Reports) and integrate APIs.
4. **CI/CD Integration**: Configure GitHub Actions to run tests, static analysis, and style checks on pull requests.

## 3. UI Implementation Plan

Below is an instruction prompt template for an AI agent tasked with reviewing and improving the UI.

```markdown
### AI Agent: UI Review & Integration Task

You are an AI agent working on the Libralink2 project. Follow these steps:

1. Review the current Blade views in `resources/views/vendor/argon`:
   - Identify recent changes to UI components and layouts.
   - Note missing or inconsistent UI elements.

2. Verify routing integration:
   - Inspect `routes/web.php` to ensure each view is correctly mapped to routes.
   - Confirm route names match view file names and controller methods.

3. Validate model integration:
   - Check that data passed from controllers to views uses correct Eloquent models.
   - Ensure each view displays dynamic content (e.g., book lists, categories) and handles no-data cases.

4. Generate a report of issues:
   - List UI inconsistencies, routing mismatches, and data binding errors.
   - Provide code snippets and suggestions for fixes.

5. Implement fixes:
   - Update Blade templates to align with design guidelines.
   - Adjust routes and controller methods to feed models into views correctly.
   - Write or update CSS/JS assets if needed for UI behavior.

6. Human-in-the-Loop Validation:
   - Ask the project lead (you) to manually run `php artisan serve`.
   - Navigate through key UI workflows to verify that implemented fixes meet requirements.
   - Collect your feedback on UI functionality, design consistency, and usability.
   - Document any additional adjustments or issues discovered.

7. Validate and test:
   - Incorporate feedback and make iterative tweaks.
   - Optionally execute automated UI tests or manual sanity checks.

8. Commit changes:
   - Follow code style and testing guidelines.
   - Update `PROJECT_PROGRESS.md` with final notes.

Use this prompt to guide your work on UI implementation.
